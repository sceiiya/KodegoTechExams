Requirements. 

Part 1 - Board state evaluator Create a function or library that, given a board state, will evaluate whether either player has won, the game has reached a draw and no further moves can improve the outcome, or the board state is illegal.

Part 2 - The Server API Scaffold a server that provides the function written in part 1 to the user as a REST API

Part 3 - The Game Frontend Build a simple web app that lets 2 players on the same computer play Tic Tac Toe. Crosses will go first, and the players will take turns clicking spaces on the game board until a conclusion is reached, at which point the players can choose to start a new game.
