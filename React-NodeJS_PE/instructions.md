Instructions
Technical Exercise
You need to build a Tic-Tac-Toe, otherwise known as Noughts and Crosses, game. This is a simple game consisting of a 3x3 grid in which players take turns making their mark (cross or circle) until either one player achieves a connected line of 3 marks or the board state prevents either player from achieving a line of 3 marks which results in a draw. More details on the rules can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe. 

In this implementation, crosses will always go first. Technical requirements 

• Please build the project using typescript, NodeJS for the backend, and react.js for the UI 

• Well formatted and commented code is expected 

• Include a readme that explains the project structure, any development environment instructions, and execution instructions 

• Deliver the solution as a single zip file of the project or a public GitHub URL paste or upload your file here at canvas

• Focus on simplicity in the solution 

• Add details in the readme or in code comments on what compromises you are making in the interest of time and what you would improve in the solution in future iterations or with more time 

• Identity in the readme or in code comments error cases that are unhandled and the impact they could have on the solution
